**Quest for Knowledge** is an educational RPG where players embark on a journey to restore true education in a dystopian world controlled by the corrupt Knowledge Syndicate. Guided by SEAI, an ancient AI system, players solve puzzles, complete quests, and engage in knowledge-based duels to uncover hidden wisdom.

## Game Overview

### Storyline

In a future where education has collapsed, knowledge is hoarded by the Knowledge Syndicate, a powerful organization bent on controlling information. Players take on the role of young scholars who discover SEAI, an ancient AI hidden in the ruins of a forgotten library. With SEAI’s help, they must challenge the Syndicate, revive true education, and uncover lost wisdom.

### Gameplay Features

- **Educational Puzzles**: Solve subject-related puzzles (math, science, history, etc.) to earn knowledge points and progress through the game.
- **Quests**: Complete story-driven and side quests, each tied to different educational objectives.
- **Knowledge Duels**: Engage in intellectual battles where knowledge, rather than combat, determines the outcome.
- **Progression System**: Earn knowledge points to unlock new regions, abilities, and content.

### Educational Integration

The game's design is built to seamlessly integrate learning into the gameplay experience. As players explore the world and complete quests, they also engage with subject-based puzzles and challenges that help reinforce critical thinking, problem-solving, and real-world knowledge across various disciplines.

### Key Elements

- **Core Subjects**: Math, science, history, literature, and more.
- **Adaptive Learning**: AI-powered NPCs provide real-time feedback and tailored guidance based on the player’s progress.
- **Knowledge Journal**: A dynamic tool to track, organize, and review all the knowledge gathered during the game, much like a Pokédex.

The game features a nostalgic 16-bit visual style inspired by classic RPGs, combined with modern educational elements. Each region is visually designed to represent a specific subject or theme, creating a rich and immersive learning experience.

- **16-Bit Visuals**: Retro-inspired graphics that evoke the charm of early RPGs.
- **Dynamic Visual Effects**: Special effects for knowledge acquisition, puzzle-solving, and battles.
- **Thematic Regions**: Each region of Eduvia has its own unique design and atmosphere, reflecting the educational theme it represents.

## Sound and Music

The game’s soundtrack and sound effects enhance the player’s immersion in the world of Eduvia, with music inspired by the calm, atmospheric tones of games like *Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *Minecraft*.

- **Thematic Scores**: Each region has its own music, matching the subject matter and atmosphere of the area.
- **Knowledge-Based Sound Effects**: Audio cues that signal puzzle-solving, knowledge acquisition, and intellectual duels.
